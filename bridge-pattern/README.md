# Bridge Pattern

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. Itâ€™s like building a bridge between two things so they can work together without being tightly coupled.


## Key Concepts

1. **Abstraction**: The high-level interface or abstract class. Defines what needs to be done and delegates the implementation to the Implementor.

2. **Concrete Abstraction**: A concrete version of the Abstraction. Extends or customizes the high-level behavior.

3. **Implementor (Bridge)**: the interface for low-level operations. Defines how the tasks are performed without knowing about the Abstraction.

4. **Concrete Implementor**: A specific implementation of the Implementor. Provides platform-specific or detailed behavior.

5. **Client**: Interacts with the Abstraction. Is decoupled from the details of the Implementor


## Use Cases

1. **JDBC**: Database operations (abstraction) separated from specific database drivers (implementation)
2. **React Native**: UI components (abstraction) with platform-specific renderers (implementation)
3. **Graphics libraries**: Drawing operations (abstraction) separated from device-specific rendering (implementation) 

This pattern is particularly useful when you need to support multiple platforms or implementations while maintaining a consistent API.
